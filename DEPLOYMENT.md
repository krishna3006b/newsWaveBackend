# Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying your NewsWave Backend to Vercel.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Vercel CLI installed (`npm i -g vercel`)
- Thirdweb account with a secret key
- Git repository (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Test locally first:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

1. **First-time deployment:**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to link your project
   - Choose your Vercel account/team
   - Set project name (or use default)
   - Confirm deployment

2. **Subsequent deployments:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   # or
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Step 3: Set Environment Variables

**This is the most important step!**

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your NewsWave Backend project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
4. Add a new environment variable:
   - **Name**: `THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your actual Thirdweb secret key
   - **Environment**: Select all three (Production, Preview, Development)
5. Click **Save**

## Step 4: Redeploy

After setting environment variables, you must redeploy:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Step 5: Test Your API

Your API will be available at:
- `https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/ipfs/upload`
- `https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/ipfs/fetch/:cid`
- `https://your-project-name.vercel.app/api/ipfs/gateway/:cid`

## Troubleshooting

### "Environment Variable THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY references Secret which does not exist"

**Solution**: This error occurs when you try to reference secrets in `vercel.json`. 
- Remove any `env` section from `vercel.json`
- Set environment variables directly in Vercel dashboard
- Redeploy your project

### API endpoints return 500 errors

**Solution**: Check that:
- Environment variable is set correctly in Vercel
- Environment variable is available in all environments
- You've redeployed after setting the variable

### CORS errors

**Solution**: The API already includes CORS headers. If you still get CORS errors:
- Check that you're calling the correct endpoint
- Ensure your frontend is making requests to the right domain

## Environment Variable Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets to Git** - Use `.env` for local development only
2. **Set variables for all environments** - Production, Preview, and Development
3. **Use descriptive names** - `THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY` is clear and specific
4. **Redeploy after changes** - Environment variable changes require redeployment

## Local vs Production

- **Local**: Uses `.env` file
- **Production**: Uses Vercel dashboard environment variables
- **Development**: Can use either, but Vercel dashboard is recommended for consistency

## Need Help?

- Check the [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs)
- Review the [Thirdweb Documentation](https://portal.thirdweb.com/)
- Ensure your Node.js version is 18+ (check with `node --version`)
